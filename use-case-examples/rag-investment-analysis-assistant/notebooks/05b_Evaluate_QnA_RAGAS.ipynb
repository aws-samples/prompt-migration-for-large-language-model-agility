    "RAGAS is a framework that helps to evaluate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. RAG denotes a class of LLM applications that use external data to augment the LLM context. It provides a variety of LLM-powered automated evaluation metrics. The below metrics are introduced evaluating RAG use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer Precision: Measures how accurately the model generated answer contain relevant and correct claims compared to the ground truth answer.\n",
    "- Answer Recall: Evaluates the completeness of the answer, i.e., model's ability to retrieve all correct claims comparing to the ground truth answer. High recall indicates that the answer thoroughly covers the necessary details in line with the ground truth.\n",
    "- Answer Correctness: The assessment of Answer Correctness involves gauging the accuracy of the generated answer when compared to the ground truth. This evaluation relies on the ground truth and the answer, with scores ranging from 0 to 1. A higher score indicates a closer alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth, signifying better correctness.\n",
    "- Answer Similarity: The assessment of the semantic resemblance between the generated answer and the ground truth. This evaluation is based on the ground truth and the answer, with values falling within the range of 0 to 1. A higher score signifies a better alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth.\n",
